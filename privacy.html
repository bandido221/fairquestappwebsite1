    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 30, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Scope.</strong> This policy applies to the FairQuest website and Android/iOS apps (“Services”). It explains what we collect, why, how we use/share it, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Account &amp; Profile:</strong> email address, username, display name, optional profile photo; vendor/performer details you choose to add.</li>
      <li><strong>Content You Provide:</strong> fair submissions, team/guild info, quest/check-in photos you upload.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> <em>approximate and/or precise</em> location <em>with your permission</em> to power nearby fairs, check-ins, and optional local/geofence features (see “Location” below).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage &amp; Diagnostics:</strong> screens viewed, taps, device type, language, performance and crash logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> user ID and push token (e.g., FCM) to deliver notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Gameplay/Progress:</strong> points, tokens, achievements, check-in history, saved/bookmarked fairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li>Provide core features (accounts, teams, fairs, check-ins, rewards, bookmarks).</li>
      <li>Show nearby fairs and verify check-ins (uses location when permitted).</li>
      <li>Send service notifications (account updates, team changes, reminders).</li>
      <li>Maintain security/anti-abuse; comply with law; enforce terms.</li>
      <li>Analyze and improve reliability, performance, and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p><strong>What we access.</strong> With your permission, the app may access <em>approximate</em> (coarse) and/or <em>precise</em> (fine) location. On Android, we may request <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> and/or <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code>. We only request <code>ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION</code> if you enable geofence-based features.</p>
    <p><strong>Why.</strong> (a) Show nearby fairs and local content; (b) verify check-ins (confirm you are within a fair’s radius); (c) optional geofence reminders/automatic check-in if you turn them on.</p>
    <p><strong>Foreground vs. Background.</strong> Location is typically used while you use the app. If you enable geofence features, your OS may deliver geofence/location events when the app is not open to make those features work. <em>Background location is off by default and entirely optional.</em></p>
    <p><strong>What we keep.</strong> We do <em>not</em> continuously record your path. For check-ins, we may store the fair identifier, geofence center/radius, and the fact that a check-in occurred with timestamp. We do not maintain a continuous GPS trail.</p>
    <p><strong>Sharing &amp; sale.</strong> We <em>do not sell</em> location data. We share it only with service providers that help deliver mapping, geofence, analytics, or hosting and who are bound by contracts restricting use to our instructions.</p>
    <p><strong>Your control.</strong> You can deny or revoke location permission any time in device settings, and you can disable geofence features in-app (if provided).</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>In-App Location Disclosure (shown before permission):</strong><br/>
      “FairQuest uses your location to show nearby fairs and verify check-ins. If you enable reminders, we may process geofence events in the background. You can deny or change this anytime in Settings.”
    </div>

    <h2>Photos &amp; Camera</h2>
    <p>Camera access is used only when you choose to capture photos for quests or fair moments. Photos may be uploaded to secure storage to support in-app features. We do not use facial recognition or sell photos. You can deny camera access and still use non-photo features.</p>

    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>We use a device push token to send notifications (e.g., team updates, check-ins, reminders). Manage or disable notifications in device settings.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services (Processors)</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (authentication, database, file storage, realtime) — stores account/profile data and app content under encryption. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Firebase/Google</strong> (push messaging, analytics, crash reporting) — delivers notifications and collects usage/performance metrics. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Image/CDN hosting</strong> — serves user-uploaded images and assets efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers act on our behalf and are contractually restricted from using your data for their own purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data. We share data only with processors above, with other users when you intentionally interact (e.g., team members see team info), with authorities when required by law, or with a successor in a merger/acquisition with appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h2>Data Safety Alignment (Google Play)</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> collected for <em>App functionality</em> (nearby fairs, check-ins). Background processing occurs only if you enable geofence features. Not sold. Shared only with processors.</li>
      <li><strong>Device or other IDs / Diagnostics:</strong> used for analytics and crash reporting to improve stability. Not sold.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><em>Contract</em> (to provide the Services you request).</li>
      <li><em>Legitimate interests</em> (security, integrity, product analytics).</li>
      <li><em>Consent</em> (e.g., location permission, notifications where required).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li>Access/update profile info in-app.</li>
      <li>Control permissions any time in device settings (location, camera, notifications).</li>
      <li>Opt out of non-essential communications.</li>
      <li>Request account/data deletion: <a href="mailto:fairquest2025@gmail.com">fairquest2025@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep data while your account is active or as needed to provide the Services. Examples: profile (while account exists); check-in/points history (while needed for rewards and auditing); diagnostics (short periods to improve stability). We delete or de-identify data when no longer needed.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit/at rest where supported, access controls, monitoring). No system is 100% secure; we continually improve our defenses.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may process and store information in countries other than where you live. When we transfer data, we use appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable law.</p>

        <h2>User-Submitted Content (Vendors & Performers)</h2>
    <p>Vendors, performers, and other contributors are responsible for the content they upload or submit through FairQuest. This includes profile photos, product images, booth pictures, and descriptions.</p>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li>By uploading content, you confirm that you own the rights to it or have permission from the copyright holder to use it publicly.</li>
      <li>You agree that uploaded images, names, and descriptions may be displayed on the FairQuest website and apps to help users discover fairs, vendors, and performers.</li>
      <li>If you believe content has been uploaded without permission or violates intellectual-property rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:fairquest2025@gmail.com">fairquest2025@gmail.com</a> so we can review and remove it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>FairQuest is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us to request deletion.</p>
