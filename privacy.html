    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 30, 2025</p>

    <p>At FairQuest, we value your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information on the FairQuest website and mobile app (“Services”).</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Account &amp; Profile:</strong> email address, username, display name, optional profile photo, vendor/performer details (if you choose to create/associate these profiles).</li>
      <li><strong>App Content You Provide:</strong> fair submissions, team/guild information, quest/check-in photos you choose to upload.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data</strong> (see “Location” section below): approximate and/or precise location <em>with your permission</em> to power nearby fairs, check-ins, and optional local features.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage &amp; Diagnostics:</strong> app events (pages/screens viewed, taps, feature usage), device type, language, basic performance and crash logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> user ID, and mobile push token (e.g., FCM token) used to deliver notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Gameplay/Progress:</strong> points, tokens, achievements, check-in history, saved/bookmarked fairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li>Provide and operate core features (accounts, teams, check-ins, fairs, vendors/performers, bookmarks, rewards).</li>
      <li>Show nearby fairs and verify check-ins (uses location when permitted).</li>
      <li>Send service notifications (e.g., account updates, team changes, reminders) and optional promotional messages.</li>
      <li>Maintain safety, integrity, and anti-abuse/fraud controls.</li>
      <li>Analyze and improve product performance, reliability, and user experience.</li>
      <li>Comply with law and enforce our terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p><strong>What we access:</strong> With your permission, the app may access your device’s <em>approximate</em> and/or <em>precise</em> location.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> to (a) display nearby fairs and local content, and (b) enable check-in and related features (e.g., validating you’re within a fair’s radius). If you enable optional reminders or automatic check-in, we may evaluate geofence events to trigger those features.</p>
    <p><strong>Foreground vs. Background:</strong> Location is typically used while you are using the app. If you enable features that require geofences to work reliably, the OS may allow the app to receive location/geofence events when the app is not open. You can turn these features off in-app (if provided) and you can revoke location permission at any time in your device settings.</p>
    <p><strong>What we keep:</strong> We do not continuously record your path. For check-ins, we may store the fair identifier and geofence center/radius and the fact that a check-in occurred (with timestamp). Raw GPS points are not stored on an ongoing basis for tracking.</p>
    <p><strong>Sharing &amp; sale:</strong> We <em>do not sell</em> location data. We may share it only with service providers that help us deliver mapping/geofence/analytics and are bound by contracts restricting use to our instructions.</p>

    <h2>Photos &amp; Camera</h2>
    <p>Camera access is used only when you choose to capture photos for quests or fair moments. Photos are uploaded to secure storage to support in-app features and are not sold or used for third-party advertising. No biometric or face recognition is performed. You can deny camera access and still use non-photo features.</p>

    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>We use a device push token to send notifications (e.g., team updates, check-ins, reminders). You can manage or disable notifications in your device settings. Notification content is limited to FairQuest features and updates.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services (Processors)</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (authentication, database, file storage, realtime): stores your account/profile data and app content under encryption. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Firebase/Google</strong> (push messaging, analytics, crash reporting): delivers notifications and collects usage/performance metrics. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Image &amp; media hosting/CDN</strong> (as applicable): serves user-uploaded images and assets efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers act on our behalf and are contractually restricted from using your data for their own purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data. We share data only with: (a) service providers listed above; (b) other users, when you intentionally interact (e.g., team members see team-related info); (c) authorities when required by law; or (d) a successor in a merger/acquisition with appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><em>Contract</em> (provide the Services you request).</li>
      <li><em>Legitimate interests</em> (security, integrity, analytics to improve the Services).</li>
      <li><em>Consent</em> (e.g., location permission, notifications where required).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li>Access and update profile information in-app.</li>
      <li>Control permissions at any time in device settings (location, camera, notifications).</li>
      <li>Opt out of non-essential emails or notifications.</li>
      <li>Request account/data deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:fairquest2025@gmail.com">fairquest2025@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services. Typical examples: profile data (while your account exists), check-in records/points history (while needed for rewards and auditing), diagnostics (short periods necessary to improve stability). We delete or de-identify data when no longer needed.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit/at rest where supported, access controls, and monitoring). No system can be 100% secure; we work to protect your information and continually improve our defenses.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may process and store information in countries other than where you live. When we transfer data, we use appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>FairQuest is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided us personal data, contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>In-App Disclosures &amp; Permissions Summary</h2>
    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> used for nearby fairs and check-ins; optional background processing may occur if you enable geofence-based features. Manage in device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera:</strong> used only when you capture photos you choose to upload.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> used to deliver account and team updates; manage in device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Questions or requests? Email <a href="mailto:fairquest2025@gmail.com">fairquest2025@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as FairQuest grows. We will post updates here and, if changes are significant, provide additional notice (e.g., in-app).</p>
